As the new year begins, there's the inevitable temptation/obligation to make changes and resolve to Do Things
Differently. Where that falls down for me is that I append new ideas the old list, never reach those ideas, and then add
more again the next year.

For this year I'm not going to add more jobs to the list, but rather I will make a concerted effort to revise and then
finish what's on there. Over the Christmas break I've been trying to reduce the piles of unwatched films and unread
books. Being full of the cold has not been helpful, but I have made progress. If I reduce those then I will be able to
make more time for other projects. 

For now, the tangible, physical media are the ones to focus on, removing the visible reminder of tasks not yet
completed. 

With learning Japanese, there isn't a physical part to track, but after two years of learning vocabulary I'm still no
further on with conversation. As with other hobbies, I've neglected that in favour of continuing along the known path.
This year I'll be dedicating more time to grammar and reading, with practise that focuses on conversation. _HelloTalk_
should be invaluable, and since another trip is booked, there's a deadline set in stone.
