There's so much to learn with vim, or neovim as I'm now using. At some point I need to go through
all the plugins in my vimrc and work out if I'm actually using them or not.

Before that though, I should learn a lot more about the available commands. For years I've been 
creating a new line and then pasting a previously yanked value into it. Turns out that `:pu[t]` will 
automatically insert the contents of the register on a newline.

That's yet another manual I need to read.
